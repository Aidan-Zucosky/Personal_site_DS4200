    <p class = "B">Lately, I have been really interested in Jean Paul Gaultier.
        I often think about how we use clothing as a form of self-expression. What are we trying to
        communicate through what we wear, and how successful are we at doing that?
        About a month ago, Duran Lantink presented his first collection for the house.
        It received a fair amount of criticism, criticism I can definitely understand. His ideas felt
        somewhat unfinished. At this point, I would have preferred to see a continuation of
        Glenn Martens’ work from his collaboration with Gaultier. However, since Martens is currently
        leading both Margiela and Diesel, he wasn’t able to take on Gaultier as well. Still, I am hopeful.
        I am excited to see how Lantink’s vision and designs evolve during his time at Jean Paul
        Gaultier, and I have high expectations for the upcoming couture show.</p>
