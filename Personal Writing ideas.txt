For my website, I have decided to make all the text a readable but fun font. The colors are also intended to be bright but still understandable. Often in web design, we walk a tight line between overdone and boring. I tried my best for this assignment to make a clear distinction. In addition to that, I scaled up the font size. This was mainly due to the limited information on the site, which enabled me to make everything slightly larger.
